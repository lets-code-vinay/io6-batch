1. The company you work for has just been awarded a contract to build a payment gateway. In order to help move things along, you have volunteered to create a function that will take a float and return (IN STRING FORMAT) the amount formatting in dollars and cents.

   _39.99_ becomes: _$39.99_

   _3_ become _$3.00_

   _3.1_ become _$3.10_

   _4500_ become _4500Rs._

2. Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

   1. ‘world’ => ‘dlrow’
   2. "Honey bees make honey" ==> "'yenoh ekam seeb yenoH'"
   3. “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle” ==> “battle no requires which that is victory greatest The”
