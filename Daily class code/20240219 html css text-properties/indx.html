      Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series
      began in Japan in 1996 with the release of the video games Pokémon Red and
      Blue for the Game Boy.[1] In these games, the player assumes the role of a
      Pokémo
    </p>

    <p class="poke">
      The designs of each Pokémon started as pixel art sprites by the
      development team first, with a single color identity chosen to work within
      the Super Game Boy hardware limitations.[4] With the early development
      team consisting of three men,[5] character design lead Ken Sugimori
      brought female developers into the project feeling they would be better
      able to create "cute" designs.[6] While conceived as a group effort by
      multiple developers at Game Freak,[6] the finalized designs and artworks
      were done by Ken Sugimori. Originally tasked with drawing the characters
      to illustrate a planned strategy guide by Game Freak when the games
      released, Sugimori drew all the sprites for the game in his style to not
      only unify their designs visually but also modify any design elements he
      felt were amiss, while trying to retain the original sprite artist's
      unique style.[7] While some Pokémon have been attributed to certain
      developers over the years, such as Atsuko Nishida for Pikachu and Motofumi
      Fujiwara for Eevee and its evolutions, Game Freak has avoided attributing
      many Pokémon to particular individuals to keep a sense of all the
      developers being involved in their creation.[6][4]
