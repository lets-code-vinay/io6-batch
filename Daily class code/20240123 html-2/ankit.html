      It is said that in <b>Ulthar</b>, which lies beyond the river <i>Skai</i>,
      no man may kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him
      who <strong>Sitteth</strong> purring before the <em>Fire</em>. For the cat
      is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see. He is the
      soul of antique Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in
      Meroe and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungles lords, and heir to the
      secrets of hoary and sinister <strong><em>Africa</em></strong
      >. The <mark>Sphinx</mark> is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but
      he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath
      forgotten. That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen
      again. And the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all
      the village there was not a cat to be found. From each hearth the familiar
      cat had vanished; cats large and
      <strike>small, black, grey, striped, yellow</strike> and
      <del> white</del> <ins>Blue</ins>.

      <br />
      <br />
      <u>Old Kranon</u>, the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had taken the
      cats away in revenge for the killing of <small>Menes kitten</small>; and
      cursed the caravan and the little boy. But Nith, the lean notary, declared
      that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect; for
      their hatred of cats was <big>notorious and increasingly bold</big>.
      Still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little
      Atal, the innkeepers son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats
      of Ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and
      solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance
      of some unheard-of rite of beasts. The villagers did not know how much to
      believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had
      charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old
      cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard.

      In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there
      dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats
      of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the
      voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run
      stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason,
      this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat
      which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after
      dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly
      peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man
      and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of
      the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under
      spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the
      owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of
      berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet
      or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When
      through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard
      after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by
      thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished.

      For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats
      first came. One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered
      the narrow cobbled streets of Ulthar. Dark wanderers they were, and unlike
      the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year. In
      the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from
      the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but
      it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had
      painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and
      the heads of cats, hawks, rams and lions. And the leader of the caravan
      wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwixt the horns.
