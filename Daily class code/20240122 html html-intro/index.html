      incredibly cute and original cuddly in a shade of gentle gray. He’s
      pleasantly delicate and soft. It can be used as a unique companion of
      children's fun. Made of the highest quality materials, with great care at
      every stage of creating the toy. Thanks to this, the mascot is safe
      toddlers from Price: PLN 67.00

      The melting Arctic is a crime scene, and I am like CSI Ny-Ålesund. Trond
      is the anonymous perpetrator leaving evidence and clues for me to
      discover, like breadcrumbs leading back to him. “Jonna,” he had said, the
      day we first met at the research institute, “If you are going to make it
      up here, don’t lock your doors.” It seemed like a life philosophy, rather
      than a survival tip.

      It is ironic. Out on Kings Bay, the coal miners came first, then the
      science outposts. Trond was already out here mining the Arctic when I was
      still just a bright-eyed undergrad, out to save nature from the ravaging
      capitalists.

      When we met, we both understood immediately that we were on opposite
      sides. I guess sleeping with the enemy isn’t out of the question when it
      is seventeen below. At winter’s end, we both got the tattoo “79 ° North”
      on our shoulders. After flask after flask of bittersweet Jägermeister Mule
      and a night of cross-country skiing on the fjord to observe the Northern
      Lights, there seemed to be a permanence in the gesture. A holiness to it.
      Sacramental and sacred. We weren’t big drinkers and we had used a month of
      drinking credits to line our shelves, to consecrate the occasion.
