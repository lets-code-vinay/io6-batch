  ----Position--
    1. Static : default
    2. Relative
    3. Absolute
    4. Fixed
    5. Sticky


    1. Static:  This is a default position property of every element existed on DOM
    2. Relative:  It independent respective element. 
                  If you give direction (top, bottom, left,    right)
                  It will move from it's original position/location.
    3. Absolute:  Absolute is dependent on its parent. with property of position: relative;
                  If it doesn't find parent with position:relative then go upward(parent to parent).
                  If it doesn't find any parent with position:relative then it makes body as its parent
    4. Fixed:     To fixed any element over the website we use position:fixed and direction
                  .chat-icon{
                    position:fixed;
                    top: 10px;
                      bottom : 10px;
                    left: 10px;
                      right: 10px;
                    z-index
                  }
    5. Sticky:    It has both value of position:Static and position:fixed
                  Initially it behaves like normal element
                  when user scrolls it sticks at given position
                   .chat-icon{
                    position:sticky;
                    top: 10px;
                    z-index
                  }
                  Note: Sticky will work only when there is scroll bar/scroll

        Z-index:
                  When we give position property to elements. It makes layers and moved upwards 
                  at z-axis.
                  lower z-index will be at bottom
                  higher z-index will be on top level

          description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first
          mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It
          describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design
          of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced
          by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
          (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
          still exist in HTML 4.[8] HTML is a markup language that web browsers
          use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
          visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item
          of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics
          can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use
          of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO
          technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes
          the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by
          the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
          (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting
          commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to
          manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized
          markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes)
          rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup.
          HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
