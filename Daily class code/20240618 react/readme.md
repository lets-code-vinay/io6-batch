- React is based on virtual-dom. Virtual DOM is different from Real DOM.
  Or we can say virtual DOM is a replica of RealDOM, Whatever we have written in React that reflects on Virtual DOM. Then It checks which nodes are different or updated on
  Virtual DOM. Then it updates only those nodes on the RealDOM. It will reduce the rendering time of webpage. React works on React fiber or reconciliation process. This process uses diffin algorithm. This algorithm checks and compares the changed nodes on virtual-DOM and on real DOM. Then changes got updates on Real DOM
