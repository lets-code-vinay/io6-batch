          <p>
            I tow my dead father with me to the scorched heart of a desert. His
            body guilts down my shoulders, heavier each time he doesn't tell me
            that I took the wrong turn, that I need to straighten my elbows,
            that I never do anything the right way so why does he even bother.
            My jeep sputters and chokes under our weight as it brings us to the
            parking lot in front of the hotel. Vipassana, reads the sign above
            the glass door, melted open at the hinges. The Silent Retreat. Heat
            slaps me across the face. I backpack my father around my waist and
            march to the door before time turns the road into quicksand. There's
            nothing here. Just miles and miles of red sand yellowing into glazed
            waves, and the mirage of an industrial glass giant towering in the
            middle – sand and post-sand, glass made of sand, sand made of glass.
            All the hotel’s walls are transparent; on all floors people go
            through the motions of the day and if they can see me, they give no
            sign of it. Inside, the light warps, skitters off the grains of
            chimes suspended on the ceiling and sinks into the terracotta floor.
            I can’t quite help waiting for the building to flip. They take my
            name — my father’s name — and check me in. They roll the suitcases
            away for me and try to take my father too, but I don’t let them
            unwrap him from my neck. My father doesn’t speak a word as I make my
            way up the staircase, but neither does anyone else, which is exactly
            why I came here. We cross the corridor. A man waves at me through
            the doors to the left, as he hovers a few inches off the floor. I
            don’t wave back and I don’t stop. In my father’s voice, I think
            that’s a cool party trick, but it’s a lot of effort for very little
            gain. The door reveals a tiny bedroom – just a bed, not a corner
            free to leave your slippers on the side. I lower my father to the
            floor and crouch to get in — the door snaps shut behind me before I
            can drag him inside. It’s hot, sauna-steamy; my back drools sweat,
            my fingers slide off the handle. It’s locked. What kind of hotel
            does that? I bang my fist on the glass. How could they lock me
            inside? Looking around the room, I find no emergency button, no
            keycard slot, no lock. There’s barely space to breathe. I bang on
            the door with both hands now until my knuckles hurt and the door
            foams up from my breath so much I can barely see my father scowl. We
            wouldn’t be here if not for you. I don’t know which one of us thinks
            that. I slide down to the overheated floor, back turned on my
            father, and claw into my thighs. Maybe he’d speak if I didn’t stop
            calling him dad in high-school, just because my friend said calling
            him father will make his shouts hurt less. It’s too hot. I can’t get
            out. I don’t want to be here alone. I fall right through the door
            and land on my back. Before I can so much as gasp, the ochre tiles
            cave and swamp me in. I grasp my father’s wrist and in a stream of
            light, we plummet down. Wet. Lukewarm water whips my back, only to
            tear easily as a screen door. We sink right through it. I open my
            eyes to deep blue. The water’s salty on my lips, burns my eyes. My
            father weighs me down. I try to shake him off — if only he lets me
            go, I can swim up. I’ll come back for him later. He clings on —
            maybe he’d trust me to come back if I ever returned his calls like I
            promised. If I ever got that second opinion. Don’t panic. If there’s
            a pool, there’s a ladder. We can get out. I see it. To the left, not
            far at all. Weighted down, I swim towards it frog-style. I never did
            learn the crawl like my father wanted me to, even though it was
            better for my crooked spine and would be much faster now. The ladder
            dissolves in my fist, as if it was never there at all. Why did I
            trust it even for a second? I can’t swim up — above us, the water’s
            molasses-thick. Inch by inch, I let my father go. He’s light, full
            of air, his face so puffed out he looks like no one at all. He could
            float up. If only he floats up, maybe I won’t drown. But no matter
            how hard I push him up, he won’t go. He’s waiting for me to
            apologise, I can see it in his frown — doesn’t he know I’ll get
            water in my lungs as soon as I open my mouth? Glancing down, I can
            just about make out a shape, an edge of a silhouette. Swimming there
            is easier, especially when I hook my arm around my father’s ankle to
            take him with me and, for once, he doesn’t fight back. The lower we
            get, the more the dark disperses into light, the more it yellows out
            like an old bruise. There are sand dunes here, a lake’s bottom —
            bare and gray. But not empty. Right in the middle, there’s a bed and
            on the bed, shrouded in white, a man. He’s not lying down, just
            drifting above it, arms crossed on his chest. His hair floats up,
            tangles around my leg, slimy like seaweed. He reaches out, waves at
            me. I’ve got no choice — I clasp his wrist. He pulls me down and
            throws the sheet over my head. It’s night. Cool, dry. I shed the
            cover and look up to a starless sky. Cold air is a relief before it
            starts to frost my breath. There’s sand here, too, sand everywhere,
            washed out to a midnight blue. Beside me, my father lays akimbo, the
            sand snowflaked in his hair, glimmering white. His merino wool
            jacket is unzipped. We watched a Bear Grylls episode once, where he
            carves out a hole in a dead camel and spends the night inside. My
            father’s chest’s too small for that. I huddle beside him for the
            little warmth that it gives. The wind picks up. I rake my fingers
            through the sand, scoop it out and raise my hand above my head to
            watch the breeze blow it out of my fist, grain by grain. We must be
            outside, or maybe underground. The longer I lie there, the more the
            wind sounds like footsteps. I’m tired, but I force myself to lift up
            on my elbows and look around. There’s people everywhere, walking
            with their gazes trained on the road ahead, wrapped up to the chin
            in robes and blankets — have they been here from the start? My
            father never liked other people. He never liked me very much, but I
            think that’s only because I reminded him of himself. I never much
            liked him for the same reason. And the drinking. And that one time
            he hit mum. Even if he were to hit her again, I’d like to have him
            back. He’s silent. People swarm around us. As they pass by, they all
            kick sand over our bodies and soon we’re half buried in it. I like
            how heavy it makes me — so heavy I almost feel safe here. I’d like
            to sleep. My father smells of rot. His skin peels from his cheeks,
            from his jaw, flakes like old paint. I can’t keep him. He’s silent —
            the more people crowd around us, the more of them step right over
            our bodies, the more silent he is, the more he falls apart. He’s
            never going to complain about anything again. It’s peaceful, almost,
            the falling apart. Someone stops next to us. I see the tips of their
            shoes, dipped into the ground, silver. I raise my head from my
            father’s disintegrating lap. Her face is moon-pale. She smiles, and
            when I try to smile back, she waves at me. I almost wish she’d
            speak. Instead, she fishes out a small sachet from a pocket in her
            robe. It plops down on my chest. When I untie the silver string, all
            I find inside is more sand. She crouches next to me, digs through
            her pockets again, and hands me my room card. I don’t know when I
            lost it. With a long, white finger, she points at me, then at my
            father, then at the sky. I can see now that it’s all glass, has
            always been glass. There’s no stars but there is a single crack,
            where the light gets in, from which more sand rains on us. I spill
            the contents of the sachet into my open palm. Wind lifts most of it,
            but I manage to catch some in a quick fist. The pale woman holds my
            eyes in hers, but can't offer any words, so I don’t know what it is
            she wants me to do. I don’t know what my father would want me to do.
            I only know what I can. I turn to him — his eyes are no longer my
            eyes, bleached out. I lean over him, hand to my chin, and blow the
            sand into them. The sun hangs high up as I check out of the hotel,
            and the receptionist hands me a manilla card. Thank you for
            completing all the five stages. I bury my dad in the middle of a
            desert along with a chunk of my scorched heart. Sand crunches on my
            way back to the jeep — I think there’s more of it now. Through the
            glass hotel walls, I can see people moving inside. They still don’t
            pay me any mind. The inside of my car overheated and now smells like
            fried plastic. I don’t pull the seat back the way my dad taught me
            to, all I do is adjust the rear-view mirror. In it, I catch a sliver
            of his face, rough with age and an unkempt beard. He’s only there
            for a glimpse, one grain, and when I glance over my shoulder, the
            seat is empty. I roll my neck and turn back towards the road;
            there’s no pain in my back. I start the engine. My dad smiles at me
            from the mirror, from my eyes. “Way to go, kid,” he says. Or maybe:
            “Time to go.”

            <span class="big-b">D</span>ear Professor Rhodes, I hope this email
            finds you well. I must confess that, although we have never met, I
            am a longtime admirer of your work—I was actually at your talk on
            Charlotte Brontë and Elizabeth Gaskell last year, which I greatly
            enjoyed. I write to you today to express my sincerest compliments on
            your paper The Beast Within: Mirrors and the Internalized Male Gaze
            in Jane Eyre.
            <br />
            I know better than anyone how difficult it is to find something new
            to say about such a beloved piece of literature, but you managed it
            exquisitely here. You have me rethinking a book I thought I knew
            better than anyone else living. I’m currently teaching an upper
            level seminar on feminism in gothic literature, and I had my
            students read your paper in conjunction with good old Jane, so I
            thought it was only right that I reach out and let you know how much
            fruitful discussion it has engendered. And—seeing as you’re clearly
            an expert on the subject—would you happen to have any suggestions
            for my little seminar? It’s my first time teaching the course, so
            any guidance would be much appreciated. Warmest Regards, Frederick
            Laird Associate Professor of English Language Arts, Greer State

            (Brilliant) Paper on Mirrors/Jane Eyre Dear Professor Laird, First,
            my heartfelt thanks for your kind email. I’m sure you know as well
            as I that toiling away in the humanities often feels like shouting
            into a void. These papers that fill our waking hours are no small
            things, and yet we send them out into the ether, to be read by ten
            people if we’re lucky. So your generous compliments have made my
            week, and I would be delighted to help a fellow Jane enthusiast in
            any way I can. Would you believe me if I said I’ve long been a fan
            of yours, too? I actually just referred a particularly enterprising
            student to your (thrilling and evocative!) paper I Eat Men like Air:
            Du Maurier’s Rebecca as a Plathian Heroine earlier this week. One of
            life’s funny coincidences. If you choose to believe in those, that
            is—a la Mary Shelley, I do not. Anyways, on to your seminar. It
            sounds fascinating! I wish my college would release me from English
            101 and Writing for Accountants purgatory and let me teach courses
            like that. If you’re teaching Jane, then I assume you’re also doing
            Rebecca, especially considering your own research. Might I recommend
            a recent Bluebeard retelling, one that’s more on the nose—Anna
            Biller’s divisive but worthy Bluebeard’s Castle? It might be a
            welcome reprieve from all those buttoned-up Brits if you’re up for
            it! Finally, a question (or two!) for you, which you need not answer
            if they offend you. Do you find it strange to teach a feminist
            literature seminar as a man? Do you think your gender gives you a
            unique perspective, or do you find it a hindrance? Please let me
            know if I can provide any further assistance; I so rarely get to
            discuss such interesting fare! Yours in Scholarship, Elise Rhodes
            Assistant Professor of English Literature, Elliott College ***

            fredericklaird@greerstate.edu RE: RE: Your Brilliant Paper on
            Mirrors/Jane Eyre Professor Rhodes, Many thanks for your quick,
            thoughtful response. And I’m so flattered that you enjoyed my
            paper—I agree that validation is sadly rare in our chosen
            profession, and your kind words mean the world to me. I was
            unfamiliar with the book you suggested, but I’ve just acquired a
            copy/done a cursory read and it looks to be a perfect fit for the
            class. Certainly controversial, but I think my students will enjoy a
            spirited debate. There is a dearth of modern gothic literature, and
            I’m so grateful to you for your excellent recommendation. To answer
            your questions, which did not offend me in the least: yes, I do find
            it to be a little strange. I’m the only professor in my department
            with this particular expertise, but I still wonder if I’m right for
            the class. However, while I would never go so far as to say that a
            man could have a better perspective on feminism than a woman, I am
            not much hindered. The books do the work themselves, really. Thank
            you again, and I will keep you apprised of how the seminar goes, if
            that’s agreeable to you. Regards, Frederick Laird P.S.: You truly
            don’t believe in coincidence? Mary Shelley notwithstanding, I
            believe you’re in the literary minority on that. I leave you with
            Tolstoy: “All this is only the coincidence of conditions under which
            every organic, elemental event of life is accomplished.” *** Friday,

            didn’t try to claim some unique male perspective on feminist
            literature—it would have disappointed me to end such an interesting
            conversation. I don’t know if I should be flattered or concerned
            that you took my recommendation so quickly. Looks like I’m not alone

            not thank me. Please, keep me posted! Best, Elise (if we are to
            continue these emails, I must insist on first names!) P.S.: It
            almost seems like cheating to punctuate your point with Tolstoy—the
            man was so wordy that he has a pull-quote for just about anything! I
            leave you with Albert Einstein, who I would argue knew more about
            so-called coincidence than any author: “Coincidence is God’s way of

            Fred’s Lack of a Personal Life Elise, No apologies needed. Your joke
            was both appropriate and spot-on. I—like you?—am “married to the

            even after twelve years. And here I’d been told academia was where
            the money was. Anyways, I had a thought about my seminar. What about
            Northanger Abbey? A gothic satire could be a fun addition, and I’d
            love to include Jane Austen. Even if this was admittedly far from
            her best. Let me know what you think. Fred P.S.: I hope you don’t
            mind that I started a new chain. Scrolling through the old one was
            exacerbating my eyestrain. P.P.S.: I’m out of quotes, so agree to
            disagree on coincidence. P.P.P.S: Do you have anything interesting
            going on? This conversation is feeling far too me-centric. ***

            That’s a relief! And, yes, I suppose I’m in the same sort of
            marriage (though mine is only eleven-years strong)—if only it
            weren’t so one-sided. I think my department forgets I exist half the
            time. I think Northanger is a wonderful idea! You said you needed
            guidance, but your instincts are faultless as far as I can tell. I
            love the Brontës, but I agree that a light satire to break through
            all that gloom would be welcome. Though you’re right that it’s far
            from Jane’s best—that would have to be Persuasion for me, Pride and
            Prejudice be damned. Enjoy the weekend! Elise P.S.: “Interesting”
            and “me” don’t often overlap. Unless you consider grading a mountain
            of Freshman essays (most of which will inevitably be written by
            ChatGPT) to be interesting? I am driving up to my sister’s this
            weekend, though. And I promised I’d leave my laptop at home for
            once, so I’ll probably be out of reach until Monday. *** Friday, Jan

            fredericklaird@greerstate.edu RE: RE: Fred’s Lack of a Personal Life
            Elise, I’m sorry, and very surprised, to hear about your
            professional dissatisfaction. If someone of your caliber feels
            forgotten, I can only assume that your department is woefully
            mismanaged. And I should have guessed you would be the one to agree
            with me on Persuasion. My colleagues have accused me of being
            contrarian just for the sake of it, but I’ve always found it to be
            Jane’s most romantic work. There’s a pervasive melancholy to it that
            reflects a total departure from something like Emma, and I (perhaps
            selfishly) love the idea that more realistic characters who are past
            their youthful prime can still find perfect happiness. That it was
            Jane’s final novel makes me mourn her early demise all the more—who
            knows where she would have gone next? I hope you have a safe trip
            and a relaxing weekend. Fred P.S.: It seems coincidence is not the
            only thing we disagree on. From our limited correspondence, I can
            already tell that a Venn Diagram of “Elise” and “interesting” would
            be a circle. *** Saturday, Jan 20, 11:19 PM To:

            seen by anyone and somehow you;ve done it over email. And yes yes

            looked you up on facebook and we know everything you;ve done since
            2008. I can’t believe you were in marching band?? You should
            probably private that before your students find it. PPS: i think

            RE: Elise after a bottle of wine Elies, I’m glad you’re having fun
            with your sister, even if she did liquor you up then leave you to
            fend for yourself. And I’d say 2 days of emails is plenty. It’s not
            like I have anything better to do on a Sunday morning, considering
            my well-established lack of a personal life. Which you apparently
            know far too much about now—I think I’ll skip private-ing and just
            delete my Facebook entirely. I shudder to think of someone (else)
            important finding evidence of my frosted tips phase. It hardly seems
            fair that I don’t know anything embarrassing about you, although I’m
            sure you’d argue that your last email suffices. We’ll call it even
            for now; I suspect your embarrassment when you wake up will be even
            worse than the hangover (not that I think it should be, to be
            clear.) Yes, of course Wentworth’s letter is the best part. I agree
            that emails are a sort of modern equivalent to letters, and I think
            that the well-known ease of texting makes choosing to send emails
            all the more romantic. I hope you don’t feel too bad when you wake
            up. Fred P.S.: I won’t lie and say it’s pleasant, but I recommend a
            shot of pickle juice for the hangover. Believe it or not, the
            marching band drank as much as any fraternity. *** Sunday, Jan 21,

            Elise, I just realized that I used the word “romantic” without
            clarifying which of its multiple definitions I intended. I meant
            “romantic” in the sense of an idealized, aestheticized view of the
            past, nothing more. I hope you didn’t think I misunderstood the tone

            sorry for being MIA. I hope you didn’t think I was offended by
            anything you said! It was just my own embarrassment, and I didn’t
            see any of your responses until now (and now that I have, you have
            nothing at all to be embarrassed about?). Honestly, I’ve been
            avoiding my email since I woke up on Sunday. Which has been
            especially difficult because this is my work email! I needn’t have
            worried, though. Of course you would be so nice about it. Still, I
            promise that’s the last drunk email you’ll be receiving from me—I’m
            swearing off alcohol for the foreseeable future! Anyways, yes, I
            like the idea that there’s something romantic about emailing over
            texting. Actually, emails are almost a perfect marriage of the past
            with the present—we acknowledge that technology has facilitated ease
            of communication without completely doing away with the formalities
            and idiosyncrasies that gave letters character. While it might be
            easier for us to exchange numbers if we plan to keep this
            conversation up, I suggest we don’t, at least for now. How’s your
            week going? Any updates on the seminar? Elise P.S.: Thank you for
            giving me interpretation rights on “romantic;” that was very
            generous of you. I’ve always been of the camp that you should assume
            the most popular definition unless the author indicates otherwise.
            And if the author indicates otherwise, but immediately "strikes that
            from the record", then I guess that puts us back at the most popular
            definition of "romantic." Which is perfectly fine by me. Unless
            you’d like to issue another correction? P.P.S: Call me crazy, but I
            didn’t think the frosted tips looked that bad.
